check the steps in 04-BANKS_AND_PAYROLLS_ESM.md
since all been implemented check if there is anything that suggested something like that
 " it will be implemented after applying that steps etc, since all steps been applied so 
 we can apply that skipped ones if exist "


now start implementing the next step  from 04-BANKS_AND_PAYROLLS_ESM.md, don't forget the global rules.  
read the file all first then start implementing cuz you might find some useful notes. 
Execution Tracker (Update As You Implement)

now check the application of banks and payrolls modules is there any points to be needs improvements.



now we have implemented  all steps in 04-BANKS_AND_PAYROLLS_ESM.md, and prepare manual ( kullanım kılavuzu ) for bank 
and payrol modules, example case usaages, in detail for users who has no coding knowledge. so it should be detailed
and explicit explanatory, which options for what which one to choose which one not to chose, and in those cases
what happens etc.
